Description: From criminal investigation to courtroom: get exposure to the real world of crime scenes, policing and investigation. Learn about how crime is detected by the police using a range of investigative techniques, particularly forensic evidence, and how this is presented to a jury within a court of law. This course has been validated to include an optional Sandwich Placement year in industry.
Are you interested in crime, forensic science, policing and the law, but unsure which subject to study? You’ll cover them all on our course. We combine the crime scene examination part of forensic science with other crime-related subjects, such as policing, intelligence and the law. This means that, when you graduate, you’ll have a wide range of criminal justice career options to choose from.
Use our superb crime scene laboratories to learn the skills of a crime scene examiner. We’ll help you to understand the practical aspects of crime and investigation, and how they affect everyday life. You’ll look at different types of crime, from burglary through to murder, and find out how these are investigated by the Police. You’ll also learn how to investigate mass disasters, such as plane crashes and tsunamis, and discover how forensic pathology and anthropology is used.
Our course will explore traditional investigative methods used by the Police in addition to newer aspects of policing, such as evidence-based policing. You will also learn how to present professional reports in both a policing environment and within a court of law.
Our lecturers have first-hand experience of crime scene examination, policing and criminal justice. As well as benefitting from their knowledge, you’ll have guest lectures from visiting professionals and get an understanding of the workplace through visits to places such as the Crown Court, and other field trips.

Description: Prepare for an exciting and challenging career in the construction industry with our Civil Engineering course. The Foundation Year course option enables you to study for our BEng (Hons) degree over an extended full-time duration of four years by including a Foundation Certificate (year one of four). The Foundation Certificate provides a broad study programme that underpins your degree. Civil engineers build power stations, bridges and motorways. On this course, you’ll gain the technical, managerial, economic, theoretical and environmental skills to enable you to apply yourself to both the management and design of civil engineering projects. You will also develop the key transferrable skills that modern employers require, such as problem solving, project planning, presentation and communication. Our strong links to industry enable you to apply your learning to problem-based scenarios in order to develop your intellectual and practical abilities. You will learn about hydraulics, examining how water flows and drives turbines, and your studies will be enhanced through site visits, field trips and guest lectures. The course meets the specific requirements of professional bodies, enabling you to progress in your career as a civil engineer. It’s an exciting time to study in Birmingham – the city is undergoing huge regeneration. This means that there are many opportunities, now and in the future, for those working in the built environment. Also, in 2017, we are spending £8.7 million on improvements to our Millennium Point facilities so you’ll have even more access to dedicated, industry-standard equipment.

Description: Operating department practitioners (ODPs) are a vital part of the operating theatre team, with their role varying from day to day. Working alongside surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and healthcare support workers, ODPs ensure that every operation is as safe and effective as possible. While receiving continuous individual support and guidance, this course prepares you to become an independent practitioner within the operating department environment, able to respond to changes in health care needs and priorities. You will learn and practice in a real-life operating theatre, and benefit from excellent employability rates. Successful completion of this course means you will be eligible to apply for registration as an ODP with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), and can work within a multidisciplinary operating theatre team.

Description: If you’re fascinated by aircraft, spacecraft and related technologies then this course is for you. You’ll learn about aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, systems, flight dynamics, mechanical engineering and computer-aided design. You’ll apply this to analyse and design flying vehicles. In Year 2 you will begin Private Pilot License theory studies, taking you well on your way towards a flying career.
In Year 3 you will complete a research project which will allow you to work creatively on an aerospace-related subject. In Year 4 a group design project will give you valuable experience in team working and development processes. Also in Year 4 you will undertake theoretical studies at ‘Air Transport Pilot License’ level.
You’ll work with a range of vehicles and use different types for design, analysis, simulation and test. You’ll get involved with unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.
You’ll graduate with a rounded education in aerospace engineering, be prepared for a wide range of career options, taking ideas from concept through to flight.
Engineering graduates are in greater demand than ever. Many career options are available to you because of the broad and diverse nature of Aerospace Engineering. These include the aerospace, space, defence, automotive, biotechnology, computing, electronics, energy and manufacturing sectors. If you’re interested in the scientific and mathematical aspects of the discipline, you can carry on into a career in research and teaching, including postgraduate aerospace research degrees at UCLan.
You will be entering a diverse and exciting area of technology where you will benefit from UCLan’s investment in the Engineering Innovation Centre which is due to open in 2019. UCLan’s Aerospace Society organises invited lectures, events, visits and competitions and during your studies you will be encouraged to join the Royal Aeronautical Society and to participate in local branch events.
You’ll have the chance to undertake a year-long industrial placement before your final year. We will support you through the application process in order to help you to secure a placement that is related to aerospace engineering. This placement is a great opportunity for you to broaden your horizons and to consolidate your learning. The experience will be invaluable when you return to UCLan, as well as giving you a significant advantage in your employability and early career development.
You can either apply for MEng Aerospace Engineering with Pilot Studies or MEng Aerospace Engineering with Pilot Studies and Industrial Placement. You would have the option to transfer from one course to the other, depending on you are successful in gaining a placement. Note that the academic content of both courses (placement and none placement programme) is identical.

Description: If you’re fascinated by aircraft, spacecraft and related technologies then this course is for you. You’ll learn about aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, systems, flight dynamics, mechanical engineering and computer-aided design. You’ll apply this to analyse and design flying vehicles. In Year 2 you will begin Private Pilot License theory studies, taking you well on your way towards a flying career.
In Year 3 you will complete a research project which will allow you to work creatively on an aerospace-related subject. In Year 4 a group design project will give you valuable experience in team working and development processes. Also in Year 4 you will undertake theoretical studies at ‘Air Transport Pilot License’ level.
You’ll work with a range of vehicles and use different types for design, analysis, simulation and test. You’ll get involved with unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) for civil applications.
You’ll graduate with a rounded education in aerospace engineering, be prepared for a wide range of career options, taking ideas from concept through to flight.
Engineering graduates are in greater demand than ever. Many career options are available to you because of the broad and diverse nature of Aerospace Engineering. These include the aerospace, space, defence, automotive, biotechnology, computing, electronics, energy and manufacturing sectors. If you’re interested in the scientific and mathematical aspects of the discipline, you can carry on into a career in research and teaching, including postgraduate aerospace research degrees at UCLan.
You will be entering a diverse and exciting area of technology where you will benefit from UCLan’s investment in the Engineering Innovation Centre which is due to open in 2019. UCLan’s Aerospace Society organises invited lectures, events, visits and competitions and during your studies you will be encouraged to join the Royal Aeronautical Society and to participate in local branch events.
You’ll have the chance to undertake a year-long industrial placement before your final year. We will support you through the application process in order to help you to secure a placement that is related to aerospace engineering. This placement is a great opportunity for you to broaden your horizons and to consolidate your learning. The experience will be invaluable when you return to UCLan, as well as giving you a significant advantage in your employability and early career development.
You can either apply for MEng Aerospace Engineering with Pilot Studies or MEng Aerospace Engineering with Pilot Studies and Industrial Placement. You would have the option to transfer from one course to the other, depending on you are successful in gaining a placement.

Description: Many diseases have a well-characterised genetic basis, while others are multifactorial with a genetic component. This course will give you an opportunity to explore genetic disease, the types of mutations leading to disease, and the consequences for treatment. Genetic analysis forms an important tool for the clinician, and developing parallel bioinformatics tools will lead to more effective personalised treatments. A further important aspect of medical genetics is the provision of evidence and advice for the genetic counsellor. The molecular revolution will continue well into this century and the number of effective genetic treatments will increase – so be well prepared to take part.
If you are interested in studying this course with a Foundation Year, please note you will be taught at the University of Chester for your Foundation Year, and subsequent years of study (Levels 4, 5 and 6) will be based at University Centre Shrewsbury.

Description: If you would like to study for a degree but do not have the qualifications required to enter directly into Level 1 of a three-year degree programme, then this Extended programme offers you an alternative route into higher education. This extra year of study, Level 0, prepares you for degree-level study and has been carefully designed to support and motivate you as well as build your self-confidence. Whether it’s investigating a type of cancer or understanding the cause of food poisoning, biomedical scientists play a crucial role in diagnosing disease and evaluating effective treatment. Doctors make decisions based on the results of tests carried out by biomedical scientists in the pathology laboratory, while patients benefit from their experience and expertise. Without their skills, key hospital departments such as Accident and Emergency couldn’t operate effectively. Our course offers an in-depth understanding of the causes of disease and the practical ways in which they can be investigated in the laboratory. These are the fundamental areas of knowledge that you’ll need as a biomedical scientist.Course Leader Dr Claudio Scotti believes the popularity of the course is because it's “broad-based”. It’s ideal for students who want to make a career in bioscience but have not yet decided in exactly what area to specialise.

Description: Ensuring that a building project runs smoothly, with enough materials, equipment, workers and money to deliver it, is a huge task. So, too, is monitoring construction quality and progress. This course will give you the knowledge and contacts to take on that kind of responsibility. You’ll learn a broad range of skills in your first year, sharing modules with Civil Engineering and Surveying. Later you can choose to specialise in specific construction management disciplines. Thanks to our excellent links with industry, graduates from this course have gone on to work on projects all over the world. Some have been involved with UK construction projects such as the Shard and the Olympic Athletes’ Village in Stratford. Others have travelled internationally to areas of dynamic regeneration such as Dubai or Qatar. Many of our overseas students go back to work in countries such as Nigeria and Malaysia Your most likely job on graduation will be an assistant site manager, working in a role where you have responsibility for a broad range of activities. If you perform impressively on site, and deal well with people, you could soon find yourself taking responsibility for really large projects. A typical project will take 18 months or two years, during which time you’ll be working very closely with a wide variety of people performing different jobs. Say you’re working on a rail project, or on the London Underground. Work often needs to be scheduled for weekends and Bank Holidays. You might spend six months planning for one Bank Holiday weekend, booking in equipment, materials and labour. Imagine the satisfaction you’ll feel when everything you have planned for comes together. It’s a hugely challenging but hugely rewarding area of employment.

Description: If you love sport and want to help others get the most out of their abilities and talents, then this course is ideal for you. It’s perfect if you want a degree in this area but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree. We have no hesitation in singing the praises of our sports therapy course. “I think it’s the UK’s leading course, based on its design, its brilliant staff and its location right next to the Olympic Stadium,” says Course Leader Michael Cole. “I think it’s unbeatable.” It’s a bold claim, but we believe our three-year course – potentially four if you choose our placement year option – merits it. Why? Because it produces sports therapists who’ve had the benefit of expert teaching, plenty of practical experience and whose skills are always in demand. If you want to work with injured athletes and help them back to full fitness and competition, this course is for you. You won’t just be there to step in when injury occurs, though. You’ll also need to learn and understand the sports science behind a successful diagnosis as well as how to manage injuries.  With us, you’ll become highly employable and earn a reputable professional degree from which you can build a successful career.

Description: Here’s a chance for you to study while making a difference to people’s lives. This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Public Health and Health Promotion but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. First we prepare you for your degree during the foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree. Public Health is everybody’s business – and promoting good health has to be, too. This course is all about understanding the need to improve the health, wellbeing and quality of life of entire societies. It also explores how we go about promoting the healthier choices and lifestyles which will achieve just that. At the University of East London, we run two excellent courses specialising in these two areas – our BSc Public Health and our BSc Health Promotion degrees – and this course neatly dovetails these two important, closely related disciplines. In studying Public Health, you're focusing on what is for the greater good of a larger population, while Health Promotion is more about working within those communities to deliver messages and healthy lifestyle programmes. It says something about the attitude of our students who choose to study both Public Health and Health Promotion. For this is a course for those who are passionate about making lives better, about social justice and about improving the way we live.

At Essex, we are a world leader in social science – two of our subjects rank within the global top 50 according to the QS World Rankings (2017). On this course, we investigate what connects people with each other, as well as what divides them.  How does the media shape social and cultural life? What is media power and who wields it? How do the creative industries work? How have digital and internet cultures transformed personal and networked interactions? What is the relationship between the media, mass politics and governance? How are consumer cultures changing? You consider these kinds of pressing contemporary questions and are taught by expert staff in our Department of Sociology, one of the UK’s leading departments for social science and cultural analysis. We teach in interesting and innovative ways with an exciting choice of modules enabling you to study sociology and the media while developing research skills. Through our Q-Step Affiliate Status, we offer you the opportunity to develop your quantitative skills by taking a specialised degree pathway or receiving a student bursary to go on a quantitative work placement. Q-Step is funded by the Nuffield Foundation.

Description: Actuaries evaluate and manage risks touching many aspects of our modern world, from determining our insurance premiums to advising on employees financial bonuses. Kent is one of the longest-established providers of Actuarial Science degrees in the UK.
Our Foundation Year programme provides an opportunity for you to develop your mathematics skills and start learning some university-level material, fully preparing you for university study before you progress onto the Actuarial Science degree.
Our specialist programme combines the in-house expertise of our professionally qualified actuaries and internationally-renowned mathematicians and statisticians to ensure you are fully prepared for your future career.
You will be encouraged to fulfil your potential whilst studying in our friendly and dynamic school based in the multi-award-winning Sibson Building.
This programme has been designed for those who have achieved grades or are predicted grades significantly lower than our standard AAA or AAB entry requirements, including overseas applicants from regions where A Level Mathematics or equivalent is not taught.
Your studies
To help bridge the gap between school and university, you’ll cover material from the A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics syllabuses, along with advanced topics taken from university-level studies preparing you for university. Alongside mathematics, you can choose optional modules covering topics from computing to history.
Upon passing the Foundation Year, you can progress onto the BSc Actuarial Science (UCAS: N323), with or without a Year in Industry.
In Stage 1 you’ll continue to receive support through small group tutorials, where you can practice the new mathematics you’ll be learning, ask questions and work with other students to find solutions. You’ll study a mixture of pure and applied mathematics, statistics and economics, providing you with a solid foundation for your later studies.
In Stages 2 and 3 you study modules that align with the professional exemptions from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), preparing you for your career as a qualified actuary.
During your studies, you will learn how to use PROPHET, an actuarial software widely used by the profession, along with other key computer software packages.
Accreditation
This year, the IFoA is introducing a new actuarial curriculum structure called Curriculum 2019.  Like most other accredited universities, we are in the process of renewing the accreditation of our Actuarial Science programmes, in order to offer exemptions under the Curriculum 2019 professional exemption structure. The IFoA is working closely with accredited universities to ensure that the reaccreditation process runs as smoothly and efficiently as possible. We expect to have completed the process for our programmes by early 2019.
Superb student experience
The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (SMSAS) at Kent has a thriving student culture, with students from all degree programmes and all degree stages participating in student activities and taking on active roles in the School. As a SMSAS student you benefit from free membership of the Kent Maths Society and Invicta Actuarial Society. You can become a Student Rep and share the views of your fellow students to bring about changes. You could be employed as a Student Ambassador, earning money while you study by inspiring the next generation of mathematicians. Or join one of the society committees and organise socials and events for SMSAS students.
You will be encouraged to make the most of your time at university and will have access to support and guidance throughout your studies.

Description: Physics reaches from the quark out to the largest of galaxies, and encompasses all the matter and timescales within these extremes. At the heart of a professional physicist is a fascination with the ‘how and why’ of the material world around us. We aim to equip you with the skills to understand these phenomena and to qualify you for a range of career pathways. This course is for students who lack the qualifications needed for direct entry onto Stage 1 of the degree programmes. The foundation year caters for students with a wide range of backgrounds and experience. At Stage 3, the combination of specialist modules and an attachment to one of our research teams opens avenues for even deeper exploration: for instance, in space probe instrumentation, fibre optics, or the atomic-scale structure of a new engineering material, or neutron scattering work.

Description: Forensic science is a high-profile subject in the UK. It has received a lot of new investment for expansion since the well-publicised miscarriages of justice in the 1970s. As a result, scientific liaison officers have been appointed by the police service and the knowledge and communication gap between the scientists and the police at a crime scene has narrowed. Forensic skills are used in a wide range of professions and industries; for instance, at disaster scenes, within archaeology and in the food and pharmaceutical industries. New legislation has stimulated demand for authentication of materials, and for experts and analytical companies to carry out the work. Forensic scientists are specialists, but their skills have to bridge several disciplines within a legal context. At Kent, the core scientific content is taught by staff from the School of Physical Sciences and the legal background is taught by staff from Kent Law School.

Description: If you have the potential to study at degree level, but you don’t meet the entry requirements, a foundation year can bridge the gap – laying the groundwork for entry into Year 1.
This programme leads to the award of BA (Hons) Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Linguistics and prepares you to progress directly into Year 1. The programme is designed to build your confidence and bring you up to speed for the rest of your chosen degree. So, as well as the Academic Skills for Higher Education unit, which helps develop your study skills for learning at the degree-level, you’ll also do three humanities units.

You will be taught by expert academics, which will guide you in gaining a solid grounding in theological principles and encourage you to apply your own ideas to key debates. You will complement this learning with independent study and research, enjoying outstanding resources such as our dedicated Manuscript and Special Collections archive. We believe that discussion and debate is a fundamental element of theological studies, therefore our classes and seminars are largely informal and close-knit and provide an invaluable space in which you will discuss your ideas.

Description: Plymouth's BSc in Economics will provide you with an in-depth knowledge of contemporary economics alongside the ability to apply that knowledge to the analysis of a range of practical situations that support both future learning and employment. The degree emphasises the acquisition of key analytical and numerical skills, and the progressive development of your capacity for independent research and learning.
The course starts with a foundation year, specifically designed to introduce and develop essential skills for success in Higher Education, including critical thinking and research skills, and the knowledge and understanding of key facets of business, accounting and economics.
The second year will develop your interest in, and awareness of, topical economic issues, and will further build your knowledge and understanding of a range of principles and theories for their analysis. Alongside this, you will begin your study of the quantitative methods used by economists and further develop your study skills.
The third year develops theories and empirical methods that are central to modern economic analysis. Core modules focus upon microeconomics and macroeconomics alongside a range of complementary elective choices (see university web pages for details).
Individual project / dissertation work and advanced economics provides the core for your final year of study. This, and a choice of options (see university web pages for details), will allow you to focus your studies on areas that particularly interest you.

Title: Maritime Business and Logistics with Foundation Year
Qualification: Bachelor of Science (with Honours) - BSc (Hons)
Provider: University of Plymouth
Provider URL: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/bsc-maritime-business-and-logistics-with-foundation-year
UCAS URL: https://digital.ucas.com/courses/details?CoursePrimaryId=98ebb388-9065-4fef-94d9-1910b772bb1e&CourseOptionId=b38011b9-aaf0-4a76-90b1-682956ffe003
Description: Would you like to make tough decisions on the speed, costs, flexibility and safety of moving goods around the globe? Shipping experts are in great demand. This four year Honours degree in Maritime Business and Logistics will help prepare you for work in a global industry which is challenging, exciting and dynamic. While technological innovation is used to establish operational advantage, this is a people industry and the success of a company depends upon the skills and knowledge of those employed.
The University of Plymouth has a tradition of maritime education stretching back to the mid-nineteenth century and you will study in a city with a famous maritime history.
The purpose of the undergraduate Maritime Business programmes is to provide a sound education for the International Shipping and Logistics industries. They cater for both entrants continuing from general education and more mature students with seafaring or other relevant industry experience.
The four-year BSc (Hons) Maritime Business and Logistics programme starts with a foundation year, specifically designed to introduce and develop essential skills for success in Higher Education, including critical thinking and research skills, and the knowledge and understanding of key facets of business, accounting and economics. In the following years of study, you will have the opportunity to deepen your knowledge, understanding and appreciation of changes taking place in the maritime business world in which, whilst the ship is still a critical part of the supply chain, other activities are also involved. Such activities include international logistics, port activity and intermodal operations.
The hallmark features of the Maritime Business programmes at Plymouth are:
 Underpinning by scholarly activity: the International Shipping and Logistics Group’s strong research profile and the scholarly activity of the staff are an essential part of the intellectual culture which pervades the courses. There is particular research expertise in the areas of International Supply Chain Management, International Shipping, International Logistics and Port Management.
 Developing key skills and employability: the programmes promote high levels of competency in key skills (including participating effectively and supportively in group work, reflecting upon learning, and evaluating personal strengths and weaknesses), that will improve your academic performance, develop your ability to communicate, enhance your employment prospects and equip you for lifelong learning.
This course is accredited by the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers, and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport. Work opportunities for logisticians are described as very good.

Description: The 4 year BSc (Hons) Tourism and Hospitality Management degree is a qualification designed for students who wish to combine their interests in tourism with their passion for hospitality. These diverse, inter-related and dynamic industries offer global opportunities for work and travel with careers ranging from hotel management and corporate hospitality to destination marketing and specialist tour operation.
The course starts with a foundation year, specifically designed to introduce and develop essential skills for success in Higher Education, including critical thinking and research skills, and the knowledge and understanding of key facets of business, accounting and tourism, hospitality and events.
In the second year, students examine the structure and management of tourism in the UK and explore the development of special interest tourism. Students will progress their understanding of the sustainable management practices adopted by hospitality organisations and, through work based learning, gain first-hand experience of hospitality operations.
The third year will equip students with knowledge and understanding of management within these industries with modules on destination management, food and beverage management and hotel operations management. To keep up with these fast-paced industries, a module on tourism technologies is also undertaken. In preparation for the final year research project, students will also develop their research skills.
Students can then choose to gain practical experience by undertaking an optional industrial placement year. Past students have worked for multinational companies including Hilton, Carnival Cruises and TUI Travel as well as smaller organisations in the UK, Europe, USA and further afield.
Whether returning from a year in industry or continuing on from the third year, students will use the final year of study to specialise in their area of interest, working with a supervisor to write a research project on a topic that excites them. Students continue to study topical issues affecting the tourism and hospitality industries while also developing transferable skills in leadership, entrepreneurship or business.
Students can tailor their learning at each stage of their degree through the range of elective modules offered. These allow students to pursue their unique interests in tourism, hospitality, cruise and management.
Industry engagement is integral to the BSc Tourism and Hospitality Management degree. Whether it is hearing from guest speakers such as ABTA, participating in work based learning with our Hotel School partners, attending conferences or undertaking a placement year, networking opportunities are embedded throughout this course, preparing our students for future employment.

Description: Our BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science degree can lead to a wide range of exciting careers in biomedical research. You’ll study in our purpose-built Science Centre under the guidance of specialist academics. Our expertise includes clinical biochemistry, medical microbiology, clinical immunology, cellular pathology and molecular diagnostics. A high proportion of your class contact time will be in the laboratory. Towards the end of Year 1, you’ll be able to apply for a competitive place on our Applied Biomedical Science route. Ideal if you are looking to become a registered biomedical scientist with the NHS, this route involves taking a 14-week clinical placement alongside your studies and enables you to complete the Registration portfolio. Doing this could make you eligible for Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) registration when you graduate. The course is accredited by The Royal Society of Biology and the Institute of Biomedical Science (IMBS). Many graduates from our Biomedical Science degree have become registered biomedical scientists in hospital diagnostic laboratories – in specialised areas such as microbiology, immunology, clinical biochemistry and with the Blood Transfusion Service. Further study on research degrees is also a popular choice for many of our graduates, while others have taken on roles in biomedical and clinical research. Recent graduates have also secured employment with the Paterson Cancer Research Laboratories, Redx Anti-Infectives and Cobra Biologics

Students will learn about the diverse ways in which languages in general, and the English language in particular, vary and change according to time, geographical location, and to factors such as the status, class or gender of the speakers. Students will develop a range of subject specific and transferable skills, including higher order conceptual and communication skills, enterprise, digital literacy and IT awareness, all of which are of immense value in graduate employment.

If you choose to take The International Foundation Year without linking the programme to a University of Wolverhampton degree route you will also develop your capabilities to study in a specific subject, at a level that will enable you to begin a degree although at another UK University which recognises the programme.
You will develop an understanding of the expectations and the academic skills required to study successfully for a degree in the UK. In addition the course  will help you use and further develop your practical skills in the particular digital environment in which you will be studying.
